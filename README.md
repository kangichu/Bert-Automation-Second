### **Part 1: Main Script for Command-Line Interface**

1. **Importing Modules and Setting Up Logging**  
   - The script begins by importing essential modules, including standard libraries (for operating system operations, system functions, logging, and argument parsing) as well as a custom logging setup from the utilities.
   - It leverages the custom logger configuration (from `utils.logger`) to standardize and enhance logging output.

2. **Command-Line Argument Parsing**  
   - An argument parser is set up using Python’s `argparse` module. The script defines several command-line flags:
     - `--run-pipeline`: Instructs the script to execute the full processing pipeline.
     - `--update-pipeline`: Indicates that the pipeline should be run in an update mode, which likely means adding new listings to an existing system.
     - `--train-only`: Specifies that only the training portion of the model (likely converting listings into embeddings) should be executed, without storing the generated embeddings.
     - `--storage-only`: Indicates that the process should focus solely on storing the embeddings, under the assumption that they have already been generated.

3. **Environment Variable Setup and Verification**  
   - The environment variable `TF_ENABLE_ONEDNN_OPTS` is set to `'0'`. This is likely done to disable oneDNN optimizations, which might be necessary for compatibility or consistency during model training or inference.
   - The script immediately verifies that the environment variable has been set correctly. If not, an error is logged, and the script exits or handles the issue appropriately.

4. **Dispatching Pipeline Functions Based on Arguments**  
   - Depending on the command-line arguments provided, the script dynamically imports and calls the appropriate pipeline functions:
     - If the `--run-pipeline` flag is set, it imports the function to run the full pipeline. It passes along the `train_only` and `storage_only` flags to control the behavior (i.e., whether to only train the model or only store embeddings).
     - If the `--update-pipeline` flag is provided, it imports and calls a function dedicated to updating the pipeline (such as adding new listings into the FAISS database).
   - If no valid flag is provided, the script presents a menu to the user. This menu describes the available operations and prompts the user to choose an option interactively. Based on the user’s input, the corresponding pipeline function is executed.

5. **Graceful Interruption Handling**  
   - The script includes exception handling for a `KeyboardInterrupt` (for example, if the user presses Ctrl+C). In such cases, a log entry is made indicating that the process was interrupted, and the script exits gracefully.

### **Part 2: The Pipeline Function Implementation**

1. **Importing Required Libraries and Functions**  
   - The pipeline module imports logging, FAISS (a library for efficient similarity search), NumPy for numerical operations, and several custom modules:
     - Functions for fetching data from a MySQL database.
     - Data formatting routines that convert raw database listings into narrative descriptions.
     - Methods to generate embeddings from narratives using a BERT model (or similar approach).
     - Functions for training a FAISS index and storing embeddings into that index.
     - A tracker for managing listings.
   - The custom logger is also set up to ensure consistent log messages throughout the pipeline execution.

2. **Pipeline Function Definition: `run_pipeline`**  
   - The main pipeline function accepts flags to determine its behavior:
     - A flag for “train only,” where the process stops after training the FAISS index.
     - A flag for “storage only,” where the process focuses on storing embeddings into an already-trained index.
     - An optional parameter for the file name of the FAISS index.

3. **Step 1 – Data Fetching from MySQL**  
   - The pipeline begins by logging that it is fetching data from a MySQL database.
   - It calls a dedicated function to retrieve listing data. If no data is fetched, the process logs an error and terminates early.

4. **Step 2 – Data Formatting**  
   - Once the raw listings are available, the next step is to format this data into coherent narratives. This conversion is essential to create meaningful text inputs that will be later converted into embeddings.
   - The formatted data includes both the narratives and the associated listing IDs. If the formatting process fails, the error is logged, and the pipeline stops.

5. **Step 3 – Embedding Generation**  
   - The pipeline converts the formatted narratives into embeddings using a BERT-based embedding generator. This step involves transforming textual descriptions into numerical vectors that can be efficiently compared and stored.
   - The code logs the number of embeddings generated and their shape. If the embedding generation fails, the process logs the error and exits.

6. **Step 4 – FAISS Index Training (Training-Only Mode)**  
   - If the “train only” flag is active, the pipeline proceeds to train a new FAISS index using the generated embeddings.
   - The training process is logged, and once complete, the function exits early, as no further processing is required in this mode.

7. **Step 5 – Storing Embeddings in FAISS (Storage-Only Mode)**  
   - If the “storage only” flag is set, the pipeline attempts to load an existing FAISS index from a local file.  
     - If the index cannot be loaded (due to file absence or other issues), the pipeline logs a warning and trains a new index.
   - The code ensures that the index is trained before adding new embeddings. If the index is not trained, it trains the index on the fly and saves it.
   - Once the index is properly trained, the embeddings are added (stored) into the FAISS index. Successful storage is logged.

8. **Step 6 – Verification of Embedding Storage**  
   - After storing the embeddings, the pipeline performs a verification step:
     - It reloads the FAISS index from the file and compares the total number of vectors stored with the number of embeddings generated.
     - A simple nearest neighbor search is conducted (using the first embedding) to verify that the index is operational.
     - If any inconsistency or error occurs during verification, an error message is logged, and the process terminates accordingly.

### **Part 3: The Update Pipeline Function Implementation**

1. **Importing Required Libraries and Functions**  
   - The update pipeline module imports logging, FAISS, NumPy, and several custom modules:
     - Functions for fetching new listings from a MySQL database.
     - Data formatting routines.
     - Methods to generate embeddings.
     - Functions for storing embeddings into the FAISS index.
     - A tracker for managing listings.

2. **Pipeline Function Definition: `update_pipeline`**  
   - The update pipeline function is designed to handle adding new listings into the FAISS index.

3. **Step 1 – Data Fetching from MySQL**  
   - The pipeline begins by logging that it is fetching new data from a MySQL database.
   - It calls a dedicated function to retrieve new listing data. If no data is fetched, the process logs an error and terminates early.

4. **Step 2 – Data Formatting**  
   - The new listings are formatted into narratives. If the formatting process fails, the error is logged, and the pipeline stops.

5. **Step 3 – Embedding Generation**  
   - The new narratives are converted into embeddings. If the embedding generation fails, the process logs the error and exits.

6. **Step 4 – Loading Existing FAISS Index**  
   - The pipeline attempts to load an existing FAISS index from a local file. If the index cannot be loaded, the process logs an error and terminates.

7. **Step 5 – Storing New Embeddings in FAISS**  
   - The new embeddings are added to the FAISS index. The tracker is updated with the new listings. Successful storage is logged.

8. **Step 6 – Verification of New Embedding Storage**  
   - The pipeline verifies that the new embeddings have been correctly stored in the FAISS index. If any inconsistency or error occurs during verification, an error message is logged, and the process terminates accordingly.

### **Part 4: Dataset Generation**

1. **Imports and Environment Setup**  
   - The dataset generation script imports various Python modules needed for its functionality, including standard libraries, third-party libraries, and custom modules.
   - Environment variables are loaded from a `.env` file using the `dotenv` package.

2. **Initializing the OpenAI Client**  
   - The script initializes an OpenAI client using the API key from the environment variables.

3. **Database Configuration**  
   - A dictionary (`MYSQL_CONFIG`) is defined with the MySQL database connection parameters.

4. **Defining Property-Related Data**  
   - Dictionaries are defined for price ranges, property name mappings, square area ranges, and amenities.

5. **Loading GPT-2 and Flan-T5 Models and Tokenizers**  
   - The script loads pre-trained GPT-2 and Flan-T5 models and their tokenizers from Hugging Face.

6. **Text Generation Functions**  
   - Functions are defined to generate text using Flan-T5, GPT-2, and OpenAI’s GPT-3.5.

7. **Utility Functions**  
   - Functions are defined for random date generation, MySQL connection, creating the database table, and inserting a listing into the database.

8. **Data Generation Helpers**  
   - Helper functions are defined for generating random amounts, square areas, property names, and amenities.

9. **Dataset Generation Function**  
   - An asynchronous function is defined to generate a dataset of property listings. This function drives the main logic of dataset generation.

10. **Script Execution Entry Point**  
    - The final block checks if the script is being run directly and executes the dataset generation function.

### **Overall Flow and Professional Considerations**

- **Modular Design:**  
  The code is well-organized into modular functions and separate pipeline scripts. Each logical component (data fetching, formatting, embedding generation, index training, and storage) is encapsulated within its own function, which enhances maintainability and readability.

- **Robust Error Handling:**  
  Throughout both parts of the code, errors are caught and logged appropriately. This includes handling API errors, database connection issues, and user interruptions, ensuring that the process fails gracefully under adverse conditions.

- **Command-Line Flexibility:**  
  By using command-line arguments and an interactive menu, the script provides flexibility for different use cases—whether it is a full pipeline run, an update to the existing pipeline, or selective operations like training or storage.

- **Logging and Verification:**  
  The logging framework is used extensively to provide clear insights into the process flow and status at every major step. Additionally, after key operations like embedding storage, a verification step ensures that the data is correctly stored and accessible.

This high-level design supports scalable and maintainable processing of listing data, transformation into embeddings, and efficient similarity search using FAISS, all orchestrated through a user-friendly command-line interface.
